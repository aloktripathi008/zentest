In the above code, we first define the Google Cloud provider with the required project and region. Then we define the number of topics to create using the locals block.

Next, we use a loop to create multiple Pub/Sub topics using the google_pubsub_topic resource. The count parameter specifies the number of resources to create, and we use count.index to generate unique names for each topic.

Finally, we output the names of the created topics using the output block.

it's recommended to configure the necessary IAM roles and permissions for the created topics to ensure secure access control.
